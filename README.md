# Hello guys. Rand here...
The quote I usually said in the video. (Subscribe to me @rand0mtutorial)

## About me
I always look like a newbie in coding because I don't make that many projects. And seems like the projects I made are not that quality as well.
When I code, I usually look up some guides on Google as well. But now, since the __ChatGPT__ has come. I will ask it instead

## Current Projects on this repository

1. Web Application
Now, I have my own website made by react.js framework and hosted by Firebase. I plan to store my coding tutorials, which I'm about to share on YouTube very soon.
You can find this project in the "web" branch.

2. Mobile Application
This project will be soon started working on, the mobile app will be likely the web application. But just make it in a mobile app to suit mobile users, so they don't need to open a browser.
You can find this project in the "mob" branch.

Feel free to fork or clone this repository for education purposes and I hope you see my talent as a front-end (probably) developer from these projects
