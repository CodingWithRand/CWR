    <p>&emsp;&emsp;My name is Thanwisit Angsachon, and my nickname is Than. Despite having those name and nickname, I&apos;m insisting on using alias names like <a className="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithRand">CodingWithRand</a> (My YouTube channel), CWR (abbrevation), or Rand0MTutorial (The previous name) on the internet, and I prefer people on the internet to call me <i>&quot;Rand&quot;</i></p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I live in Thailand, to be precise, it&quot;s in Chiang Mai which one of a popular northern city, so that means I&apos;m Thai. I&apos;m turning 18 this year.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I&quot;m currently studying in the Matthayom 6th (Equivalent to Grade 12 or Grade 13) of <a className="link" target="_blank" href="https://eng.chongfah.ac.th">Chongfah Xinsheng Wanishbamrung</a> school. It&apos;s a Thai-Chinese private school. Even though I have been studying in this school since I was 7, I&apos;m still not that good at Chinese. I still know a little bit of Chinese, but I think my fundamental of Chinese is okay I guess.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I am basically a guy who loves coding and programming. I used to spend a lot of my free time playing games, but now, I mainly stick on coding and programming.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I usually use ChatGPT to help me writing code and understand the error of the code. Beside the AI chat bot, I also search things up on search engines, looking up for the solution in Stack Overflow, and other programming blog website.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;My learning style is to learn by doing it, not just reading the documentations or complete the tutorials. I always learn through making a project about it. This website is an example of it.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Of course, I still read a bit documentations to briefly grasp the fundamental, but as I said, mainly is from making a project. These projects couldn&apos;t be accomplished without the help of the ChatGPT. Copy AI code is not the best thing to do, but you should learn from it (Why that sounds weird to me bro??)</p>
