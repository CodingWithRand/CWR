# Hello guys. Rand here...
The quote I usually said in the video. (Subscribe to me @rand0mtutorial)

## About me
I always look like the newbie on coding because I don't make that many projects. And seem like the projects I made is not that quality as well.
When I code, I usually look up some guides on the google as well. But now, since the __ChatGPT__ has come. I will ask it instead

Now, I have my own website that is made by react.js framework and is host by firebase. I hope you see my talent as a front-end (probably) developer
