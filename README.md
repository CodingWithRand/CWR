# Hello guys. Rand here...
The quote I usually said in the video. (Subscribe to me @codingwithrand)

## About me
I always look like a newbie in coding because I don't make that many projects. And seems like the projects I made are not that quality as well. When I code, I usually look up some guides on Google as well. But now, since the __ChatGPT__ has come. I will ask it instead. This repository is mainly for storing projects that are related to "*cwr*" (CodingWithRand) branding

## Current Projects in this repository
1. Web Application
> - __Portfolio Website__
> Now, I'm building my own website made in the Next.js framework and hosted in Vercel.
> You can find this project in [index](https://github.com/CodingWithRand/cwr/tree/index) branch.
> - __Programming Institution__
> I plan to store my coding tutorials, which I'm about to share on YouTube very soon. It may turn out as a learning adventure game style.
> You can find this project in [general-education](https://github.com/CodingWithRand/cwr/tree/general-education)

2. Mobile Application
> - __Plan reminder__
> This is the project I'm *__currently__* working on. And I aim to send this project for a contest. Wish me luck ðŸ˜Š
> The project is about a __mobile applications usage monitor__. Its purpose is to remind the user about their massive screen time usage, which can potentially make the user decrease their screen time.
> You can locate it in the [planreminder](https://github.com/CodingWithRand/cwr/tree/planreminder) branch.

Feel free to fork or clone this repository for education purposes and I hope you see my talent as a front-end (probably) developer from these projects
