    <h1>Origin</h1>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;My name is Thanwisit Angsachon, and my nickname is Than. Despite having those name and nickname, I&apos;m insisting on using alias names like <a className="outside-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithRand">CodingWithRand</a> (My YouTube channel), CWR (abbrevation), or Rand0MTutorial (The previous name) on the internet, and I prefer people on the internet to call me <i>&quot;Rand&quot;</i></p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I live in Thailand, to be precise, it&quot;s in Chiang Mai which one of a popular northern city, so that means I&apos;m Thai. I&apos;m turning 18 this year.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I&quot;m currently studying in the Matthayom 6th (Equivalent to Grade 12 or Grade 13) of <a className="outside-link" target="_blank" href="https://eng.chongfah.ac.th">Chongfah Xinsheng Wanishbamrung</a> school. It&apos;s a Thai-Chinese private school. Even though I have been studying in this school since I was 7, I&apos;m still not that good at Chinese. I still know a little bit of Chinese, but I think my fundamental of Chinese is okay I guess.</p>

    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I am basically a guy who loves coding and programming. I used to spend a lot of my free time playing games, but now, I mainly stick on coding and programming.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;How did I interest in coding? It&apos;s quite a long story...</p>
    <br/>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;It&apos;s started when I was around 12, I was interested in making my own <a className="outside-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com">Roblox</a> game. It was really fun to try new things.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Everyone knows there are two parts of creating a game, <i>&quot;Designing, Creating and Modeling&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Scripting game logic&quot;</i>. At first, I didn&apos;t quite understand how the code work at all. Just copying the tutorial, and that does it. I have to admit that I had more fun with modeling back then.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;But I kept learning the code anyway. Roblox is written in Lua, so of course the programming language to create the game is also Lua. After learning for a while, I knew basic of Lua and addition methods Roblox added.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Anyway, you&apos;re probably questioning me now that how did I end up interest in web development and software engineering? Well, three years past, I realized that my creativity is not enough to create a game. I didn&apos;t have cool ideas create a unique game. Pretty much lame or weird ideas that no one would interest in. (Now I have an idea to make a game that&apos;s <del>copied</del> inspired from a <a className="outside-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pFwQiwRbcg">Minecraft series video</a>, but don&apos;t have time to develop yet.)</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;When I was around 15-16, I tried something new. I learned about web development and software development. I quite liked them. One day, I have a splendid idea...</p>
    <br/>
    <p><i><b>&emsp;&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t create something that would be super useful for people around world to use on the internet?&quot;</b></i></p>
    <br/>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;And from that day, I keep learning and learning about it. Till now, I&apos;m still learning because new technologies emerge every day. I now know a lot about software and web development, but despite that, it&apos;s still a long way to go... </p>

    <h1>Learning Style</h1>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;My learning style is to learn by doing it, not just reading the documentations or complete the tutorials. I always learn through making a project about it. This website is an example of it.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Of course, I still read a bit documentations to briefly grasp the fundamental, but as I said, mainly is from making a project. These projects couldn&apos;t be accomplished without the help of the ChatGPT. Copy AI code is not the best thing to do, but you should learn from it (Why that sounds weird to me bro??)</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;ChatGPT is very helpful, because it could explain you about the error of the code, which is sometimes hard to understand. It can point out where the error come from accurately, and it can also suggest solutions. But those solutions are not always right, and because some of the require information may be outdated, missing, incorrect or explained confusingly, I have to look up the solution on Stack Overflow, or other programming blogs.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;So guys, just use it, the AI. We have to be a good prompter. This is one of the skill we need. Or else, even us programmer, our job will be taken away by AI (I&apos;m fear of Devin ðŸ˜°)</p>
